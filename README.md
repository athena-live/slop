# slop

slop is a Slop Detection SaaS concept for identifying content that sounds
confident but lacks meaning. This repo contains a static marketing site for
`slop.fit`, not the application itself.

## Website

The site is a single-page marketing experience that covers:

- Instant Slop Scan: slop score, coherence map, filler density, claim spotting,
  and optional rewrite suggestions.
- Real-time editor tools: browser extension, Google Docs add-on, and CMS plugins.
- Batch & workflow tools: bulk uploads, URL scans, queue/triage, shareable reports.
- API for platforms and publishers: pre-publish checks, moderation, webhooks.
- Guardrails modes: brand voice policies, industry templates, custom calibration.
- Pricing tiers: Free, Creator, Pro, Team, and Enterprise.

## Files

- `index.html` — landing page structure and copy.
- `styles.css` — visual system, layout, and responsive styles.
